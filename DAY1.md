# 📅 Day 1 – Internship @ Sedin Technologies

## 🧠 Focus Area: Introduction to Swift and SwiftUI

### ✅ What I Learned

#### 🔹 Swift Essentials
- **Variables & Constants**: Understanding `var` and `let`, and when to use each.
- **Data Types**: Explored `Int`, `Double`, `String`, `Bool`, and type inference.
- **Conditionals**: Implemented logic using `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.
- **Loops**: Practiced `for-in` and `while` loops to iterate over data.
- **Functions & Parameters**: Defined custom functions, passed parameters, and returned values.
- **Optionals**: Learned the concept of optional types and why they’re needed.
- **Safe Unwrapping**:
  - `if let` for optional binding
  - `guard let` for early exits and safer code flows

### 📝 Summary
Day 1 was a foundational introduction to Swift programming. I focused on understanding the syntax, control flow, and safe coding practices using optionals. These fundamentals are key to building robust SwiftUI apps.
