 Day 2 â€“ Internship @ Sedin Technologies
 
 Structs, Enums & Collections in Swift
 
 Topics Covered:

- **Structs**: Learned how to define and use `structs` to create custom data types.
- **Enums**: Explored `enums` for representing a group of related values and using `switch` for pattern matching.
- **Arrays**: Worked with ordered collections using `Array`, accessed and modified elements.
- **Dictionaries**: Used key-value pairs to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- **Sets**: Understood the use of `Set` for storing unique values.
- **Xcode Setup**: Installed and configured Xcode for iOS development.

 Summary

Day 2 focused on working with more complex data types and structures in Swift, including `structs`, `enums`, and collections like arrays, dictionaries, and sets. I also completed my Xcode setup, which prepares me to start building Swifft applic$
