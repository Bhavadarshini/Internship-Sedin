Day 3 – Internship @ Sedin Technologies

First SwiftUI App & Development Environment Setup


Topics Covered:

- **Xcode Installation**  
  Completed setup and familiarized myself with the Xcode interface.

- **Project Structure Overview**  
  Explored the structure of a SwiftUI project — including `ContentView`, assets, previews, and app entry point.

- **"Hello, SwiftUI" App**  
  - Created a simple SwiftUI app that displays a moon icon and two lines of text.  
  - Used SwiftUI components such as `Text`, `Image`, `VStack`.  
  - Applied styling modifiers including `.foregroundStyle`, `.opacity`, `.padding`, `.background`, and `.font`.


Summary

On Day 3, I created my very first SwiftUI app using basic layout and design components like `VStack`, `Text`, and `Image`. I experimented with styling using system colors, gradients, and opacity. I also learned how to push my local code to GitHub
