Day 5 – Internship @ Sedin Technologies

Controls & Weather App in SwiftUI

Topics Covered

- **SwiftUI Controls**
  - Used `Button`, `Toggle`, `TextField`, and `Slider` for user input
  - Introduced `@State` property wrapper to manage dynamic UI state

- **Mini Project: Weather Forecast App UI**
  - Designed a clean weather forecast interface using `VStack`, `HStack`, and custom components
  - Displayed weather for 5 days using SF Symbols like `cloud.drizzle.fill`, `cloud.sun.bolt.fill`, etc.
  - Styled UI with gradients, paddings, frame modifiers, and reusable `WeatherAppView` struct
  - Applied `.resizable()`, `.foregroundColor()`, and layout modifiers for responsive design
  - Implemented a consistent layout for each day’s forecast using modular SwiftUI views


Summary:

On Day 5, I explored the fundamentals of user input in SwiftUI and built a weather forecast app UI to apply layout and control concepts. I gained hands-on experience with state management (`@State`) and reusable components in SwiftUI.
