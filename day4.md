Day 4 – Internship @ Sedin Technologies

Views and Layout in SwiftUI

Topics Covered:

- **VStack** – Arranges views vertically  
- **HStack** – Arranges views horizontally  
- **ZStack** – Overlaps views on top of each other  
- **Modifiers**  
  - `.padding` – Adds spacing around elements  
  - `.frame` – Sets width and height  
  - `.background` – Adds a background to a view

Summary:

On Day 4, I explored SwiftUI’s core layout system using stack views.I implemented a mini GitHub-style profile card and used key modifiers to fine-tune spacing and appearance.This helped me understand how layout and styling work together to build structured, responsive UIs.
